            <h2 id='title-p'>Welcome to the <strong><i>Sentence-to-Password</i></strong> Creator<br><h6>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspby Jonathan Acevedo</h6></h2>
            
            <p>
                <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis tool takes a full sentence and produces a <strong>decryption key</strong>
                 and <strong>password</strong>. 
                The key produced can be later used to decrypt your password in case you forget it. The sentence could be anything from 
                lyrics, favorite movie quotes, book quotes, any memorable quote, etc. The <strong>password complexity</strong> will depend on the amount 
                of words in the sentence. <i>This tool is best useful if you can remember the full sentence</i>, but it's okay if you 
                need to store it alongside the key.
                
                <br><br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe <strong>purpose</strong> of this application is to better the way we <strong>create passwords</strong>, improve the security of password protected 
                accounts worldwide and encourage the <strong>use of secure, 
                complex & impersonal passwords.</strong> Remembering a password is often dificult for most people and we tend to store it somewhere. 
                The problem is that when we store it, we risk it being discovered by a malicious user trying to steal your account. If we
                 instead store information 
                used to calculate our password, the "hacker" would have a reasonably harder time trying to figure it out. 
  
                <br><br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou might say, <strong>"<i>Why should I try to remember a sentence when I can't even remember a password?</i>"</strong> My answer;
                <em>If you really don't have a favorite quote, song or lyric that you can remember, you can just save the sentence & key together.</em>
                Saving those is safer than saving a password since the key & sentence would be useless to someone who doesn't know which method 
                you used to create your password. 
                
                <br><br><br>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbspPasswords should be <strong>smart</strong>, <strong>relatively easy to 
                remember</strong>  & <strong>hard to guess</strong>. In other words, if you have a cat, <em>you
                probably shouldn't use its name in your password</em> since someone who is actively trying to access your account would resort to many methods, including 
                guessing your password based on your interests, public personal information(social media pictures, posts, etc) or other online activity. 
                So, go ahead. Make a password. <strong>It's free and always will be.</strong>
